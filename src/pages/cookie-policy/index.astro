			Hey, cookies aren&rsquo;t all that healthy anyway! We much prefer a good
			almond biscotti with our morning coffee. Or a lovely date scone. Or a
			classic sesame seed bagel toasted golden brown with a thick layer of cream
			cheese.
		</p>
		<p>Or, ooo, how about some lox?</p>
		<p>
			Or, if we&rsquo;re going all the way, a proper tiramisu then. GÃ¢teau
			Chocolate. New York Cheesecake. Sigh &hellip; Now we&rsquo;re hungry.
		</p>
		<p>Cookies. Meh.</p>
