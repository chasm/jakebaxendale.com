			&ldquo;...that&rsquo;s my way of preparation - to not be prepared. And
			that takes a lot of preparation!&rdquo; - Lee Konitz
		</p>
		<p>
			What does it mean to prepare to be unprepared? Lee Konitz&rsquo;s deft
			paradox represents a challenge to the improviser: how can one practice and
			prepare for improvising, while simultaneously aspiring to spontaneity,
			newness and the unexpected in its performance? My Master of Music studies
			at Auckland University in 2020-21 undertook to answer this question.
		</p>
		<p>
			Coming from my position as a jazz improviser in Aotearoa, my research
			built on ideas from other New Zealand and Australian artist researchers
			who have identified the need to develop personal, reflexive, and
			deliberate practice techniques to answer this question. I offered that
			&ldquo;language&rdquo; and &ldquo;vocabulary&rdquo;, common and useful
			metaphors within musical improvisation, can be practiced, learned and
			applied in ways that don&rsquo;t inhibit spontaneity in performance, but
			enhance it.
		</p>
		<p>
			I proposed that &ldquo;striking moments&rdquo;—especially engaging musical
			statements discovered during improvisation itself—can act as the genesis
			of new musical material to adopt into and adapt for an improvising
			vocabulary.

			Since acquiring my <abbr title="Master of Music">MMus</abbr>, I have run a

			Striking Moments moniker and concepts.
