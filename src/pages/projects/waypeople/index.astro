		<p>
			<strong>Waypeople</strong> is a sonic and visual journey through an ancient
			philosophical text at once solidly pragmatic and profoundly mystical. With
			lyrics drawn from author Ursula Le Guin's poetic English language version of
			the Tao te Ching, eight artists explore traditional and contemporary music
			forms, composition, improvisation, shadow, light & ink as they guide you through
			ten movements, illustrating the themes of the unseen, unheard, unnamable Tao,
			“wu-wei” (not-doing) and true Power.
