			<strong>Waypeople</strong> is a beginning. I started delving into the Tao Te
			Ching (a collection of ancient Chinese poems probably written over 2500 years
			ago in the time of Confucius by a sage named Lao Tzu) back in 2020: I was sick
			with anxiety, first from overwork and then from a sudden lack of purpose brought
			on by the COVID 19 lockdowns. My partner gave me a rendition in English by
			a favourite author of mine, Ursula Le Guin, best known for her &ldquo;Earthsea
			Quartet&rdquo;, a groundbreaking work in the Fantasy genre.
		</p>
		<p>
			This funny, insightful, mystifying and musical book has provided me
			constant comfort and inspiration since I first picked it up. Le Guin wrote
			of the original text &ldquo;as we define poetry now, not by rhyme or meter
			but by a patterned intensity of language, the whole thing is poetry. I
			wanted to catch that poetry, its terse, strange beauty.&rdquo; I would
			like to catch the music in the poetry: surprising, hard to grasp,
			sometimes leaping like a fish! Glistening, beautiful, and at home in the
			world.

			<strong>Waypeople</strong> was originally commissioned for the 2023 Wellington
			Jazz Festival, and is my first attempt to write jazz music with lyrics. I&rsquo;ve
			enjoyed playing with the sounds of the American songbook and juxtaposing them
			with this ancient wisdom: to anchor the project to its roots I utilised the
			guzheng, a Chinese zither whose origins hark back to a similar time as the
			Tao Te Ching.
