			> which simply forwards your messages to us via email. We keep no copies online.
		</p>
		<p>We will update this page if we engage any other services.</p>

			streamed from either

			<h2>Secure server</h2>
			<p>
				We serve the JakeBaxendale.com site using <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security"
					rel="external"
					>Transport Layer Security</a
				> (TLS). This encrypts communications between your browser and our server,
				ensuring your privacy.

				best practice and helps to ensure both your privacy and your security.

			<p>
				We serve the JakeBaxendale.com web site via <a
					href="https://vercel.com/"

				We also have a <a
					href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP"

				the latest best practices for security. Although there are no guarantees,
