			We collect personal information from you <strong>only</strong> when you use

		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Name</li>
			<li>Email Address</li>
			<li>Any other info you include</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We collect your personal information to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Respond to queries</li>
			<li>Provide updates to subscribers</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<strong
				>We do not collect or use your personal information for any purpose
				other than those given above.</strong

		</p>
		<p>
			Providing this information to us is optional. We do not share your
			information with other parties. Ever. If you do not enter contact details,
			then you will not receive communications from us. It is up to you.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you do provide personal information, then we keep it safe. We do so by
			storing it securely online. These data are accessible by the
			JakeBaxendale.com server and our web developers.
		</p>
		<p>
			That said, we presume that the employees of the online data services can
			access the data as well. Currently, we use two services.
		</p>
		<p>
			One is <a
				href="https://www.mailerlite.com/"
				rel="external"
				>Mailerlite,</a
			> which maintains lists of subscribers (name and email address). The other
			is
			<a
				href="https://postmarkapp.com/"
				rel="external"
				>Postmark,</a
			> which is used to send form submissions to us via email, but does not retain
			the content.
		</p>
		<p>
			You have the right to ask for a copy of any personal information we have
			of yours. We will make any corrections you desire or delete your
			information at your request. If you&rsquo;d like to ask for a copy of your

			<h2>Secure server</h2>
			<p>
				We serve the JakeBaxendale.com site using <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security"
					rel="external"
					>Transport Layer Security</a
				> (TLS). This encrypts communications between your browser and our server,
				ensuring your privacy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Use of <abbr title="Transport Layer Security">TLS</abbr> is the current industry
				best practice and helps to ensure both your privacy and your security.
			</p>
			<p>
				We also have a <a
					href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP"
					rel="external"
					>Content Security Policy</a
				> (CSP). We run a suite of automated tests to ensure that our site follows
				the latest best practices for security. Although there are no guarantees,
				we do our best to make JakeBaxendale.com as safe and secure as possible.

			<h2>Privacy by Design</h2>
			<p>
				We do our best to follow the seven <a
					href="https://www.onetrust.com/blog/principles-of-privacy-by-design/"
					rel="external"
					>Privacy by Design</a
				> principles:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Proactive not reactive; preventive not remedial</li>
				<li>Privacy as the default setting</li>
				<li>Privacy embedded into design</li>
				<li>Full functionality—positive-sum, not zero-sum</li>
				<li>End-to-end security—full lifecycle protection</li>
				<li>Visibility and transparency—keep it open</li>
				<li>Respect for user privacy—keep it user-centric</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Our thoughts</h2>
			<p>We don&rsquo;t get why so many people want to spy on others.</p>
			<p>
				We do get why big, sociopathic organizations want you to think that your
				data belongs to <em>them,</em> not you. Then they monetize that data for
				their own benefit. And, no matter what they say, to your detriment. It&rsquo;s
				because they suck.
			</p>
			<p>You heard it here first.</p>
			<p>
				JakeBaxendale.com is a <strong>craft</strong> operation, not a giant, soulless
				corporation. We are so small that there is almost no &ldquo;we&rdquo;.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our only interest is conversing with you. We don&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t
				sell anything to anyone. Heck we operate this site at a loss. Which
				makes it a win for everyone. Except <em>them.</em>
			</p>
			<p>Hope that helps.</p>
